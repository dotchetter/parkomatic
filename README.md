# Parkomatic

## What is it?
Parkomatic is a project to automate and alleviate the chore of finding parking regulations for a given location, and paying for parking.
Since many companies are involved in charging for parking in Sweden, our goal with this project is to make it a seamless experience for 
motorists to park their vehicle no matter the service provider.


# Key features

## Integration with mobile app
Through the app, you can see where your car is parked and the regulations for that location. The device will automatically 
register the car as parked, when it's internal motion co-processor detects this condition depending on multiple factors.

## Automatic P-disc functionality
The Parkomatic's primary objective is to eliminate the need to use a P-disc, by displaying the time of when the car was parked
on the builtin display, visible for park rangers. 


# What state is the project in? 
The project is under development and is currently in phase 1 prototyping.
